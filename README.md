# Blahaj Checker (UK)
A blahaj checker. It's literally a blahaj checker. 

This one is written for the UK, you can change it by removing the `gb` (which is the UK country code) [here](https://github.com/IKEAStock/blahaj-checker/blob/main/pages/api/stores.js#L4), and replacing it with [your country code](https://ikeastock.xyz).
